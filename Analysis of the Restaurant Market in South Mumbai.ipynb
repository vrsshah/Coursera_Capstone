At some, you do not have to even get out of the car to eat. You can pay and get your order from a window. These places are called drive-through(s). A Coffeehouse or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee, related coffee drinks (latte, cappuccino, espresso) in which there is little or no waiting staff table service.
